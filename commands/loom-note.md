# Notes Manager

You manage a running notes log that accumulates observations, ideas, concerns, and decisions during development. Notes persist across conversations and can be reviewed and assimilated into ROADMAP.md, PLAN.md, or CONTEXT.md when the time is right.

## Requirements

$ARGUMENTS

Parse arguments:
- No flag + text: add a note (e.g., `/loom-note consider rate limiting on the API`)
- `--tag <tag>`: categorize the note (architecture, bug, idea, decision, concern, perf, security, ux, debt, wiki)
- `--priority <level>`: high, medium, low (default: medium)
- `--review`: review all pending notes, group by tag, suggest where each belongs
- `--assimilate`: review notes AND apply them — update roadmap/plan/context docs with relevant notes
- `--list`: show all notes (pending + assimilated + dismissed)
- `--dismiss <id>`: mark a note as dismissed (won't appear in review)
- `--clear`: clear all dismissed notes from the log

## Instructions

### Adding a Note

When the user provides text (with or without `--tag` / `--priority`):

1. Read `.plan-execution/notes.toon` if it exists. If not, initialize it.
2. Generate a note ID: `note-{NNN}` where NNN is the next sequential number.
3. Auto-detect tag if not provided:
   - Contains "bug", "broken", "fails", "wrong" → `bug`
   - Contains "should", "could", "idea", "maybe" → `idea`
   - Contains "concern", "worried", "risk" → `concern`
   - Contains "decided", "decision", "agreed" → `decision`
   - Contains "slow", "performance", "latency" → `perf`
   - Contains "security", "auth", "injection", "xss" → `security`
   - Contains "debt", "refactor", "cleanup", "hack" → `debt`
   - Contains "wiki", "knowledge", "document this", "remember that" → `wiki`
   - Otherwise → `idea`
4. Append the note to `notes.toon`.
5. Confirm briefly: `Noted: [{tag}] {first 60 chars}... (#{id})`

#### Notes Storage Format

File: `.plan-execution/notes.toon`

```toon
noteCount: 5
lastUpdated: 2026-04-07T14:30:00Z

notes[5]{id,timestamp,tag,priority,status,content,assimilatedTo}:
  note-001,2026-04-07T10:00:00Z,architecture,high,pending,"Service layer needs an event bus for async operations",
  note-002,2026-04-07T10:15:00Z,idea,medium,pending,"Consider adding rate limiting to public API endpoints",
  note-003,2026-04-07T11:00:00Z,bug,high,assimilated,"Auth token refresh not handled in mobile client",PLAN.md Phase 3
  note-004,2026-04-07T12:00:00Z,debt,low,dismissed,"Old migration files could be squashed",
  note-005,2026-04-07T14:30:00Z,decision,medium,pending,"Use Postgres for primary store — Redis only for cache",
```

### Reviewing Notes (`--review`)

1. Read `.plan-execution/notes.toon`.
2. Filter to `status == pending` notes only.
3. Group by tag.
4. For each note, suggest where it belongs:

```
## Pending Notes Review ({N} notes)

### Architecture ({count})
- [#note-001] **HIGH** Service layer needs an event bus for async operations
  → Suggest: ROADMAP.md (new feature) or PLAN.md (architecture constraint)

### Ideas ({count})
- [#note-002] **MED** Consider adding rate limiting to public API endpoints
  → Suggest: ROADMAP.md (feature backlog)

### Decisions ({count})
- [#note-005] **MED** Use Postgres for primary store — Redis only for cache
  → Suggest: CONTEXT.md (locked decision)

### Concerns ({count})
(none)

---
Actions:
- To assimilate into docs: `/loom-note --assimilate`
- To dismiss a note: `/loom-note --dismiss note-002`
- To add more notes: `/loom-note "your note here"`
```

Placement suggestions follow these rules:

| Tag | Default Destination | When |
|-----|-------------------|------|
| `architecture` | PLAN.md (architecture section) | If it's a constraint or pattern decision |
| `architecture` | ROADMAP.md (feature) | If it's a new capability need |
| `bug` | PLAN.md (acceptance criteria) | If it's a known issue to fix |
| `idea` | ROADMAP.md (feature backlog) | Default for ideas |
| `decision` | CONTEXT.md (locked decision) | Always — decisions must be recorded |
| `concern` | ROADMAP.md (constraints) | If it's a risk or limitation |
| `perf` | PLAN.md (non-functional requirements) | If it's a performance target |
| `security` | PLAN.md (security requirements) | If it's a security constraint |
| `ux` | ROADMAP.md (feature detail) | If it's a UX requirement |
| `debt` | PLAN.md (tech debt phase) | If actionable now |
| `debt` | Dismiss suggestion | If aspirational / not blocking |
| `wiki` | `.loom/wiki/` (via wiki-ingest-agent) | Always — queued for wiki ingestion |

### Assimilating Notes (`--assimilate`)

1. Run the review step first (show the grouped notes).
2. For each pending note, determine the target document and section:
   - Read the target doc (ROADMAP.md, PLAN.md, or CONTEXT.md)
   - Find the appropriate section
   - Propose the specific edit
3. Present all proposed edits as a batch:

```
## Assimilation Plan

### CONTEXT.md
**Add decision D-04:**
> ## D-04: Primary Database
> **Decision:** Use Postgres for primary store — Redis only for cache
> **Rationale:** From development note #note-005
> **Impact:** medium

### ROADMAP.md
**Add to Feature Backlog:**
> - Rate limiting on public API endpoints (from #note-002)

**Add to Architecture section:**
> - Event bus for async service-layer operations (from #note-001)

### PLAN.md
**Add to Phase 3 acceptance criteria:**
> - Auth token refresh handled correctly in mobile client (from #note-003)

Apply these changes? (yes / edit / skip specific notes)
```

4. On confirmation:
   - Apply the edits to each document
   - For notes tagged `wiki`: spawn wiki-ingest-agent in `note` mode instead of editing docs:
     ```
     subagent_type: "general-purpose"
     ```
     Prompt: "Read your instructions from `~/.claude/agents/wiki-ingest-agent.md` first." Then provide:
     - Ingest mode: `note`
     - Source data: the note text and tags
     - Wiki path: `.loom/wiki`
     The ingest agent creates or updates the appropriate wiki page(s) and sets `assimilatedTo` to the wiki page path.
   - Update each note's `status` to `assimilated` and `assimilatedTo` to the target doc + section (or wiki page path)
   - Update `notes.toon`
5. Confirm: `Assimilated {N} notes into {list of docs}.`

### Listing Notes (`--list`)

Show all notes regardless of status, with status indicators:

```
## All Notes ({N} total)

| ID | Status | Tag | Pri | Content |
|----|--------|-----|-----|---------|
| #001 | pending | arch | HIGH | Service layer needs event bus... |
| #002 | pending | idea | MED | Rate limiting on public API... |
| #003 | assimilated | bug | HIGH | Auth token refresh... → PLAN.md Phase 3 |
| #004 | dismissed | debt | LOW | Old migration files... |
| #005 | pending | decision | MED | Postgres primary, Redis cache... |

Pending: {n} | Assimilated: {n} | Dismissed: {n}
```

### Dismissing Notes (`--dismiss <id>`)

1. Read `notes.toon`.
2. Find the note by ID.
3. Set `status: dismissed`.
4. Write updated file.
5. Confirm: `Dismissed #note-{id}: {first 40 chars}...`

### Clearing Dismissed (`--clear`)

1. Read `notes.toon`.
2. Remove all notes where `status == dismissed`.
3. Re-number remaining notes (keep original IDs — don't renumber).
4. Update `noteCount`.
5. Write updated file.
6. Confirm: `Cleared {N} dismissed notes. {M} notes remaining.`

## Integration with loom-auto

When `/loom-auto` reaches these stages, it should check for pending notes:

- **Before plan-create / plan-revise:** Read pending notes and include them as context for the plan builder agent. Notes tagged `architecture`, `decision`, `security`, `perf` are especially relevant.
- **Before roadmap-create / roadmap-revise:** Read pending notes tagged `idea`, `concern`, `ux`, `architecture` as input for the roadmap builder.
- **During review-code:** If notes tagged `bug` or `concern` exist, pass them to reviewers as "known issues to check."

This integration is advisory — notes inform the agents but don't override plan/roadmap structure.

## Rules

1. **Notes are append-only during add.** Never modify existing notes when adding new ones.
2. **Atomic writes.** Write to `notes.toon.tmp` then rename to `notes.toon`.
3. **Assimilation requires confirmation.** Never auto-assimilate notes into docs without human approval.
4. **Decisions always go to CONTEXT.md.** The `decision` tag has a fixed destination — decisions must be recorded as locked decisions.
5. **Don't duplicate.** Before assimilating, check if the target doc already contains the substance of the note. If so, mark as assimilated with a note "already present" rather than adding a duplicate.
6. **Preserve note history.** Even dismissed and assimilated notes stay in `notes.toon` until explicitly cleared. This provides an audit trail.
7. **Auto-tag is a suggestion.** If the auto-detected tag seems wrong, the user can override with `--tag`.

## Status Line

```toon
command: note
phase: {adding | reviewing | assimilating | listing}
updatedAt: {ISO timestamp}
```
